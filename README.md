Local Wordpress Development with Vagrant, Scotch Box
====================================================

The purpose of this repo is to provide an easily cloneable setup for developing in Wordpress. It uses Vagrant with Scotch Box as the base box (LAMP stack). Then it also has the Wordpress files downloaded into the public folder and a database set up so everything is ready to go on wpsite.dev with login admin/admin once you run ```vagrant up```.

Learn more about Scotch Box in the Scotch Box readme and also see public/scotch-info.php.
